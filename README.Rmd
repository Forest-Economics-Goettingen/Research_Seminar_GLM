# Introduction

Modelling survival probabilities, also known as survival analysis, is one of the most important and most suitable purposes for which logistic regression is used and which we will use as an example today. (Another widely used field of application is the analysis of questionnaires, which will be sketched in the PhD examples at the end.) The specialty of survival data is that the response variable can only have binary (or more generally categorical) outcomes. The individuals survive until a certain point in time occurs, or more generally, until a certain event occurs. The simplest models only contain the time, i.e. the age of the individuals. They give the average unconditional probability of survival. More complex models can take multiple aspects into account. The idea of survival modelling is to estimate this event and possibly additionally inference the reasons survival (or non-survival respectively). This 0/1 property is the reason, why the values of the response that are to be estimated have different outcomes than the observations of the response variable. In logistic regression, not the outcome of an observation $y_i$ (e.g. dead or alive) is estimated, but the **probability that an observation shows an outcome**, a fundamental contrast to ordinary linear regression. Logistic regression is a possibility to fit a survival probability curve over a continuous variable of interest, e.g. the tree age. Fact for the economists: Logistic regression is thus an alternative to the well-known Weibull survival curves. The regression curve has similar properties as the cumulative Weibull distribution and the the interpretation is comparable. Simply spoken, the advantage of Weibull-function is the straightforward parameter interpretation. Logistic regression comes more from the field of statistical inference and thus has more straightforward test procedures (multiple variable selection, linear hypotheses, quality of fit, ...) and is easy to estimate (in terms of programming and also technically).

# Data: `ForestHealth`

Consider the example data set `ForestHealth` from Fahrmeir et al. (2013). The data set consists of 16 variables with 1796 observations on forest health to identify potential factors influencing the health status of trees and therefore the vital status of the forest. The data in our example come from a project in the forest of Rothenbuch (Spessart), which has been carried out by Axel GÃ¶ttlein (Technical University, Munich) since 1982. Five tree species are part of this survey: beech, oak, spruce, larch, and pine. Here we will restrict ourselves to beech trees. Every year, the condition of beech trees is categorized by three ordinal categories $\[0 \% - 12.5\)$, $\[12.5 \% - 50 \%\)$, and $\[50 \% - 75 \%\)$. The forth category $>75 \%$ is not captured in the data. The category 0 % signifies that the beech tree is healthy, the category 100 % implies that the tree is dead. See Fahrmeir et al. (2013, p. 9) for more details.


__Beforehand Task 1:__ Getting familiar with the data and with the nature of binary responses

- Load `ForestHealth`, rename to `fh`
- Create a binary response variable that contains healthy (defoliation $\[0 \% - 12.5\)$) and unhealthy ($\[12.5 \% - 75 \%\)$) trees
- Perform relevant descriptive statistics to get an overview
- Which variables might have an impact on the tree health?
- Fit an ordinary linear model `lm` to estimate the health status over the age
- Add **one** another variable that seems to influence the tree health
  -   Are these two models suitable to estimate the health status? Give some pro and contra arguments and underpin your arguments using common numbers or diagrams of (linear) statistical inference.
  
```{r}

# Loading ForestHealth
load("Data/ForestHealth.rda")

fh <- ForestHealth

# Creating the binary variable diseased (0 = healthy, 1 = diseased)
fh <- fh %>% mutate(diseased = ifelse(defoliation %in% "[0, 12.5)", 0, 1))

# Overview
summary(fh)

# Linear model
fh %>% ggplot(aes(y = diseased, x = age)) + geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
lm_simple <- fh %>% lm(diseased ~ age, data = .)
summary(lm_simple)

# Multiple linear model: Age, stand
lm_multiple_1 <- fh %>% select(diseased, age, stand) %>%  lm(diseased ~ ., data = .)
summary(lm_multiple_1)

fh %>% ggplot(aes(y = diseased, x = age, col = stand)) + geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")

# Multiple linear model: Age, ph
lm_multiple_2 <- fh %>% select(diseased, age, ph) %>%  lm(diseased ~ ., data = .)
summary(lm_multiple_2)

# Marginal effects
p1 <- ggeffects::ggeffect(lm_multiple_2, terms = "age") %>% plot()
p2 <- ggeffects::ggeffect(lm_multiple_2, terms = "ph") %>% plot()

ggpubr::ggarrange(plotlist = list(p1, p2), ncol = 2)
```


# Orinary LM vs. GLM

Why is the ordinary linear models usually not suited to model binary responses (and under which conditions could a linear model might be sufficient)? Consider the results from task 1 and elaborate the question further in task 2.

__Beforehand Task 2:__ What is the difference between linear models and general linear models? What adds the G to LM?

- Read Lane (2002) and prepare for the following discussion:
    - Why do generalized linear model belong to the family of linear models even though their curvature is not linear?
    - Which properties distinguish a *generalized linear model* from a *linear* model? In particular: What is a link function?
    - Which properties distinguish a *generalized linear model* from a *non-linear* model?

# Logistic regression

The GLM philosphy is explained directly using the example of logistic regression. Generally, in contrast to LMs, GLMs have a link function and allow arbitrary assumptions to be made about the residual distribution. Other existing differences are not included.

## Theoretical background

Instead of modelling $y_i$ directly, we define a regression model that estimates the possibility of a discrete status 1 (e.g. diseased)

$$
\pi_i=\text{E}(y_i)=P(y_i=1),
$$

where $\pi_i$ shall vary continuously between 0 and 1 even tough $y_i$ is discrete. To achieve $\pi_i \in[0, 1]$, we apply a transformation (in the sense of Lane (2002)) that transforms ("links") the linear regression formula to the deserved properties. The linear regression formula (so to speak the linear core of the GLM)

$$
\eta_i=\beta_0+\beta_1 x_{i1}+ \dots + \beta_k x_{ik}
$$

is called linear predictor. Binomial regression requires a more sophisticated transformation than the log-normal regression performed in Lane (2002). However, the principle is the same.


$$
\pi_i=h(\eta_i).
$$

Along with some less familiar transformations, the logit transformation leads to the desired properties of survival analysis, which is why the binomial is sometimes referred to as logit regression. The term logistic regression comes from the logistic (s shape) curvature that follows from the logit transformation (In this sense, Weibull functions, Bertalanffy growth functions and any other s shaped regression curves are also logistic regressions). The logit response function $h$ relies on the logistic cumulative distribution function

$$
\pi=h(\eta)=\frac{\text{exp}(\eta)}{1+\text{exp}(\eta)}.
$$

The respective inverse, also called link function $h$ reads as

$$
g(\pi)=\text{log} \left( \frac{\pi}{1 - \pi}\ \right).
$$

The response function follows a Bernoulli distribution. However, grouping observation with same outcomes makes the solving process more efficient and then leads to a Binomial distribution (Fahrmeir et al., 2023, p. 270 - 277), which is why in practiced programming, the Binomial or Quasibinomial distributions are usually taken. You should stick to these standard combination of distributions of link functions, however, you can freely decide for any of the distributions of the so called exponential family if you know what you do.

## Developing a GLM by hand

We want to develop the principle of the link function by a self-programmed data transformation. 

### Global mean model

Let's start simple. We firstly calculate the mean disease probability in the sample without any covariates (even without `age`). Straightforward calculation is to calculate the ratio of successes (diseased trees) in relation to all trees as

```{r}
sum(fh$diseased) / nrow(fh)
mean(fh$diseased)


# This is the same as a linear model
m1 <- lm(diseased ~ 1, data = fh)
coef(m1)
```

Another option is to calculate an intercept only logistic regression. This option appears to be too complicated to the simple problem. We use it to underpin the how a GLM calculates the probabilities out of a sample. We come back to this.

```{r}
# GLM
glm_intercept_only <- glm(diseased ~ 1, family = binomial(), data = fh)
```

Result (prediction) is the average disease probability. Additionally, we get the prediction of the link function. Generally, the GLM output provides predictions for the response, the original scale. Look at the Theoretical background, we have the result of the linear predictor $y_i$ (`link`) and for the response $\pi_i$. In Lane (2002), this response was $y_o=\beta_0 \beta_1^{x_1}$, the link $y_i=\beta_0+\beta_1\text{log(} x \text{)}$. The link, to conclude, provides estimations on the scale of the linear predictor (here, the logit, in Lane the log). Applying the inverse of the logit function `exp(x)/(1+exp(x))` to the prediction of the link thus, again, gives the response. The `GLM` output provides both estimates.

```{r}
predict(glm_intercept_only, type = "response")[1]
(x <- predict(glm_intercept_only, type = "link")[1])

exp(x) / (1+exp(x)) # The response again
```

Analogously to Lane (2002), we can also calculate the logits by hand (we transform the data). Still for the case of a simple population mean, we get

```{r}
(p <- mean(fh$diseased))

log(p / (1 - p))# logit(p)

inv.logit(logit(p)) # short for exp(x) / (1+exp(x))
```

### Stand type (mixed / pure) model

Further developing the model, we now define groups of mixture type `stand` with differing disease probabilities. We fit a model with one discrete variable only:

```{r}
# Firstly, the GLM considering one categorical variable
glm_stand <- glm(diseased ~ stand, family = binomial(), data = fh)
summary(glm_stand)

# Again, we fetch disease probabilities for the original scale (response) and
# for the logit-transformed scale (link)

nd <- data.frame(stand = c("deciduous", "mixed"))
predict(glm_stand, nd, type = "response")
(x <- predict(glm_stand, nd, type = "link"))
inv.logit(x) # gives the response again

# A linear model does no longer work
m2 <- lm(diseased ~ stand, data = fh)
coef(m2)

```

And now the promised linear model with data transformation, the GLM by hand:

```{r}
# Do the logit transformation
d1 <- data.frame(
  stand = c("mixed", "deciduous"), 
  logit = table(fh$stand, fh$diseased) |> 
    apply(1, function(x) x[2] / sum(x)) |> 
    logit()
)
d1
# ... and then estimate an ordinary linear model.
glm_stand_by_hand <- lm(logit ~ stand, data = d1)
coef(glm_stand_by_hand)

# Backtransformation gives us the same group means as the GLM.
inv.logit(coef(glm_stand_by_hand))
```

Interim interpretation: Just as in logarithmic regression, logistic regression performs a "in-model" transformation. Doing data transformation to linearize the data leads (in this example) to the same results. Be aware that all models could also be calculated as simple group means.

### Age model

Now let's derive the typical disease model, modelling the disease probability over age to strengthen the advantages of GLM. We add the continuous variable `age`. As any observation can be 0 or 1 only, we cannot calculate $p$ for the single observations. A problem that not yet occurred (not in Lane (2002)/ never in log-linear regression, not in our simpler disease models). We need to group the original observations to create observations of $p$ for our model. Best would be to have multiple observations for each outcome of the continuous variable, which is, however, not likely for continuous variables. We thus need to define intervals of ages.

```{r}
d <- fh |> mutate(g = age - (age %% 25)) |> 
  group_by(g) |> 
  summarize(logit = logit(mean(diseased))) |> # Calc. logits for groups
  mutate(age = g + 12.5)

head(d)

glm_age_by_hand <- lm(logit ~ age, data = d) # Fit a linear regression through the logits
coef(glm_age_by_hand)
```

The logit-transformed data is indeed linear (more or less) and the back-transformed regression function shows indeed an s-shaped curve that looks familiar to survival modelers.

```{r}
p1 <- d %>% ggplot(aes(y = logit, x = age)) + geom_point() + 
  geom_abline(intercept = coef(glm_age_by_hand)["(Intercept)"],
              slope = coef(glm_age_by_hand)["age"])

p2 <- d %>% ggplot(aes(y = inv.logit(logit), x = age)) + geom_point() + geom_function(fun = function (x) {inv.logit(coef(glm_age_by_hand)["(Intercept)"] + coef(glm_age_by_hand)["age"] * x)})

# p1 + p2 # Altervative patchwork
ggpubr::ggarrange(plotlist = list(p1, p2), ncol = 2)
```


```{r}
glm_age <- glm(diseased ~ age, data = fh, family = binomial(link = "logit"))
coef(glm_age)

nd <- data.frame(age = c(10, 50, 100))
predict(glm_age_by_hand, nd)
predict(glm_age, nd)

predict(glm_age_by_hand, nd) |> inv.logit()
predict(glm_age, nd) |> inv.logit()
predict(glm_age, nd, type = "response")
```

We can do better by increasing the number of classes. And this already gives the argument why to use `GLM` instead of *do it by hand*.

```{r}
d <- fh |> mutate(g = age - (age %% 2)) |> 
  group_by(g) |> 
  summarize(logit = logit(mean(diseased))) |> 
  mutate(age = g + 1) |> 
  filter(is.finite(logit))

glm_age_by_hand_2 <- lm(logit ~ age, data = d)
coef(glm_age_by_hand_2)

predict(glm_age_by_hand_2, nd) |> inv.logit()
predict(glm_age, nd) |> inv.logit()
```

We now have many groups with 0 or very few observations. If we would include a second covariate, e.g. stand, the situations becomes even worse.

## Multiple logistic regression

GLM provides the ordinary procedures of hypotheses testing and statistical inference, similar to a linear model but different in the details. Let's fit a multiple model. The code is similar to `lm`. We here show basic principles of how a GLM can be interpreted and how its model quality can be assessed.

```{r}
glm_multiple <- fh %>% select(age, elevation, soil, ph, fertilized, diseased, stand) %>% 
  glm(diseased ~ ., data = .,  family = binomial(link = "logit"))
```

## Interpretation

We now want to look at whether other covariates contribute more than age to the likelihood of disease. First, we can interpret the summary in the usual way. The p-values indicate the significance of the covariates. However, unlike ordinary linear models, the parameter cannot be interpreted directly. The summary gives the estimates of the linear predictor, the "link" scale.

```{r}
summary(glm_multiple)
```

The model suggests that altitude might has no effect on the model, whereas age, soil and fertilization fairly contribute to the model. Also, we can read the direction from the summary in which the covariates contribute to disease probability and we can derive rankings of the effects from the parameter estimates. Positive contribution: `fertilization` > `age`. Negative contribution: `ph` > `soil` > `elevation`. However, an interpretation in the sense of *if one covariate changes by one unit, how does that alter the response variable* is not possible with the data from the summary. Best practice is to look at the curvature of the regression model. `ggeffects` provides marginal effects plots, where one effect is displayed in isolation keeping the others fixed (economists may know this principles as *ceteris paribus*).

```{r}
ggeffects::ggeffect(glm_multiple, terms = c("age")) %>% plot()
ggeffects::ggeffect(glm_multiple, terms = c("elevation")) %>% plot()
ggeffects::ggeffect(glm_multiple, terms = c("soil")) %>% plot()
ggeffects::ggeffect(glm_multiple, terms = c("age", "stand")) %>% plot()
```


### Using odds

If you want to interprete the coefficients, the odds ratio can be used. The odds give the probability of an event occuring divided by the probability that this event does not occurs ($odds = p / (1 - p)$). Hence, if the odds are 1 its as likely that event will occur or will not occur ($0.5 / (1 - 0.5) = 1$). If we now take the ratio of two odds ($OR$), we can say something about the coefficints of a logistic regression.

Lets take `glm_multiple` as example: 


```{r}
summary(glm_multiple)
```

We could calculate the OR for age, i.e., how does the OR change if age increases by 1 unit (= 1 year). To see this, we will have to calculate the odds for year = 10 and year = 11 (or any pair of values that differ by 1 unit). All other covariates are held constant. 

```{r}
p1 <- inv.logit(c(1, 10, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) %*% coef(glm_multiple))
p2 <- inv.logit(c(1, 11, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) %*% coef(glm_multiple))

(p2 / (1 - p2)) / (p1 / (1 - p1))
```

This happens to be the `exp()` of the coefficient for age. 

```{r}
exp(coef(glm_multiple)[2])
```

There are few simple conclusions you can draw about any $\beta$:

- If $\beta = 0$, the OR will be 1. 
- If $\beta < 0$, the OR will be < 1 and vice versa. 

- A OR of 2 means that the effects doubles, a OR of $0.5$ means that the effect is only half. 



## Model diagnostics

The distribution of residuals for GLMs is not obvious any longer. A method that gained popularity recently is to simulate randomized quantile residuals from your model. The `DHARMa` package provides several functions to do exactly this. The easiest way is to plot the residuals and check if they match. We can compare the linear model, where the family is obviously wrong with a glm. 

```{r}
plot(simulateResiduals(lm_multiple_2))
```


```{r}
plot(simulateResiduals(glm_multiple))
```

This looks all good.
