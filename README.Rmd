# Preamble

This README file serves as an outline of today's topics and contains or links to all materials required. This file and all materials can be found on github. Today's aims are

  - to have a loot at the type of **data** for which a logistic regression can be performed and
  - to discuss one of the most relevant examples for which logistic regression are often used. On the basis of this example, 
  - we take a deeper look the special **properties** of the logistic regression and thereby repeat the concept of generalized regression and
  - **perform and interpret** a logistic regression in `R`.
  - At the end, 2 short examples from **current research projects** are presented and discussed.
  
The martial contains contents, ideas and examples from the textbook Fahrmeir et al. (2013) as well as parts as from the associated lecture series `GLM` by Professor Thomas Kneib, Chair of Statistics. Furthermore, parts of the lectures `Statistical Data Analysis with R` and `Advanced Statistical Programming` of the forest faculty are included. We ask you to prepare some tasks beforehand to save some time in the seminar. Those are tagged as **Beforehand task**.

# Introduction

Modelling survival probabilities, also known as survival analysis, is one of the most important and most suitable purposes for which logistic regression is used and which we will use as an example today. (Another widely used field of application is the analysis of questionnaires, which will be sketched in the PhD examples at the end.) The specialty of survival data is that the response variable can only have binary (or more generally categorical) outcomes. The individuals survive until a certain point in time occurs, or more generally, until a certain event occurs. The simplest models only contain the time, i.e. the age of the individuals. They give the average unconditional probability of survival. More complex models can take multiple aspects into account. The idea of survival modelling is to estimate this event and possibly additionally inference the reasons survival (or non-survival respectively). This 0/1 property is the reason, why the values of the response that are to be estimated have different outcomes than the observations of the response variable. In logistic regression, not the outcome of an observation $y_i$ (e.g. dead or alive) is estimated, but the **probability that an observation shows an outcome**, a fundamental contrast to ordinary linear regression. Logistic regression is a possibility to fit a survival probability curve over a continuous variable of interest, e.g. the tree age. Fact for the economists: Logistic regression is thus an alternative to the well-known Weibull survival curves. The regression curve has similar properties as the cumulative Weibull distribution and the the interpretation is comparable. Simply spoken, the advantage of Weibull-function is the straightforward parameter interpretation. Logistic regression comes more from the field of statistical inference and thus has more straightforward test procedures (multiple variable selection, linear hypotheses, quality of fit, ...) and is easy to estimate (in terms of programming and also technically).

# Data: `ForestHealth`

Consider the example data set `ForestHealth` from Fahrmeir et al. (2013). The data set consists of 16 variables with 1796 observations on forest health to identify potential factors influencing the health status of trees and therefore the vital status of the forest. The data in our example come from a project in the forest of Rothenbuch (Spessart), which has been carried out by Axel GÃ¶ttlein (Technical University, Munich) since 1982. Five tree species are part of this survey: beech, oak, spruce, larch, and pine. Here we will restrict ourselves to beech trees. Every year, the condition of beech trees is categorized by three ordinal categories \[0 \% - 12.5\), \[12.5 \% - 50 \%\), and \[50 \% - 75 \%\). The forth category >75 \% is not captured in the data. The category 0 % signifies that the beech tree is healthy, the category 100 % implies that the tree is dead. See Fahrmeir et al. (2013, p. 9) for more details.


__Beforehand Task 1:__ Getting familiar with the data and with the nature of binary responses

- Load `ForestHealth`, rename to `fh`
- Create a binary response variable that contains healthy (defoliation \[0 \% - 12.5\)) and unhealthy (\[12.5 \% - 75 \%\)) trees
- Perform relevant descriptive statistics to get an overview
- Which variables might have an impact on the tree health?
- Fit an ordinary linear model `lm` to estimate the health status over the age
- Add **one** another variable that seems to influence the tree health
  -   Are these two models suitable to estimate the health status? Give some pro and contra arguments and underpin your arguments using common numbers or diagrams of (linear) statistical inference.
  
```{r}

# Loading ForestHealth
load("Data/ForestHealth.rda")

fh <- ForestHealth

# Creating the binary variable diseased (0 = healthy, 1 = diseased)
fh <- fh %>% mutate(diseased = ifelse(defoliation %in% "[0, 12.5)", 0, 1))

# Overview
summary(fh)

# Linear model
fh %>% ggplot(aes(y = diseased, x = age)) + geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
lm_simple <- fh %>% lm(diseased ~ age, data = .)
summary(lm_simple)

# Multiple linear model: Age, stand
lm_multiple_1 <- fh %>% select(diseased, age, stand) %>%  lm(diseased ~ ., data = .)
summary(lm_multiple_1)

fh %>% ggplot(aes(y = diseased, x = age, col = stand)) + geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")

# Multiple linear model: Age, ph
lm_multiple_2 <- fh %>% select(diseased, age, ph) %>%  lm(diseased ~ ., data = .)
summary(lm_multiple_2)

# Marginal effects
p1 <- ggeffects::ggeffect(lm_multiple_2, terms = "age") %>% plot()
p2 <- ggeffects::ggeffect(lm_multiple_2, terms = "ph") %>% plot()

library(patchwork)

# Orinary LM vs. GLM

Why is the ordinary linear models usually not suited to model binary responses (and under which conditions could a linear model might be sufficient)? Consider the results from task 1 and elaborate the question further in task 2.

__Beforehand Task 2:__ What is the difference between linear models and general linear models? What adds the G to LM?

- Read Lane (2002) and prepare for the following discussion:
    - Why do generalized linear model belong to the family of linear models even though their curvature is not linear?
    - Which properties distinguish a *generalized linear model* from a *linear* model? In particular: What is a link function?
    - Which properties distinguish a *generalized linear model* from a *non-linear* model?

# Logistic regression

The GLM philosphy is explained directly using the example of logistic regression. Generally, in contrast to LMs, GLMs have a link function and allow arbitrary assumptions to be made about the residual distribution. Other existing differences are not included.

## Theoretical background

Instead of modelling $y_i$ directly, we define a regression model that estimates the possibility of a discrete status 1 (e.g. diseased)

$$
\pi_i=\text{E}(y_i)=P(y_i=1),
$$

where $\pi_i$ shall vary continuously between 0 and 1 even tough $y_i$ is discrete. To achieve $\pi_i \in[0, 1]$, we apply a transformation (in the sense of Lane (2002)) that transforms ("links") the linear regression formula to the deserved properties. The linear regression formula (so to speak the linear core of the GLM)

$$
\eta_i=\beta_0+\beta_1 x_{i1}+ \dots + \beta_k x_{ik}
$$

is called linear predictor. Binomial regression requires a more sophisticated transformation than the log-normal regression performed in Lane (2002). However, the principle is the same.


$$
\pi_i=h(\eta_i).
$$

Along with some less familiar transformations, the logit transformation leads to the desired properties of survival analysis, which is why the binomial is sometimes referred to as logit regression. The term logistic regression comes from the logistic (s shape) curvature that follows from the logit transformation (In this sense, Weibull functions, Bertalanffy growth functions and any other s shaped regression curves are also logistic regressions). The logit response function $h$ relies on the logistic cumulative distribution function

$$
\pi=h(\eta)=\frac{\text{exp}(\eta)}{1+\text{exp}(\eta)}.
$$

The respective inverse, also called link function $h$ reads as

$$
g(\pi)=\text{log} \left( \frac{\pi}{1 - \pi}\ \right).
$$

The response function follows a Bernoulli distribution. However, grouping observation with same outcomes makes the solving process more efficient and then leads to a Binomial distribution (Fahrmeir et al., 2023, p. 270 - 277), which is why in practiced programming, the Binomial or Quasibinomial distributions are usually taken. You should stick to these standard combination of distributions of link functions, however, you can freely decide for any of the distributions of the so called exponential family if you know what you do.

## Developing a GLM by hand

We want to develop the principle of the link function by a self-programmed data transformation. Let's start simple. We firstly calculate the mean disease probability in the data set without any covariates (even without `age`). Straightforward calculation is to calculate the ratio of successes (diseased trees) in relation to all trees as

```{r}
sum(fh$diseased) / nrow(fh)
mean(fh$diseased)


# A linear model
#m1 <- lm(diseased ~ 1, data = fh)
#coef(m1)
# @Johannes, das kann weg oder? Das ist nicht anschlussfÃ¤hig, da das spÃ¤ter ja nicht mehr geht. Verwirrt nur?!
```

Another option, which is seemingly so straightforward at the moment, is to calculate an intercept only logistic regression.

```{r}
# GLM
glm_intercept_only <- glm(diseased ~ 1, family = binomial(), data = fh)
```

Result (prediction) is the average disease probability. Additionally, we get the prediction of the link function. Generally, the GLM output provides predictions for the response, the original scale. In Lane (2002), this response was $y_o=\beta_0 \beta_1^{x_1}$. The link, respectively, provides estimations on the scale of the linear predictor (here, the logit, in Lane the log). Applying the inverse of the logit function `exp(x)/(1+exp(x))` to the prediction of the link thus, again, gives the response.

```{r}
predict(glm_intercept_only, type = "response")[1]
(x <- predict(glm_intercept_only, type = "link")[1])

exp(x) / (1+exp(x))
```

Analogously to Lane (2002), we can also calculate the logits by hand (we transform the data). Still for the case of a simple population mean, we get

```{r}
(p <- mean(fh$diseased))

log(p / (1 - p))# logit(p)

inv.logit(logit(p)) # short for exp(x) / (1+exp(x))
```

Further developing the model, we now define groups of mixture type `stand` with differing disease probabilities:

```{r}
# Firstly, the GLM considering one categorical variable
glm_stand <- glm(diseased ~ stand, family = binomial(), data = fh)
summary(glm_stand)

# Again, we fetch disease probabilities for the real scale (response) and
# for the logit-transformed scale (link) 

nd <- data.frame(stand = c("deciduous", "mixed"))
predict(glm_stand, nd, type = "response")
predict(glm_stand, nd, type = "link")
inv.logit(predict(glm_stand, nd, type = "link")) # gives the link

# @Johannes: Weg oder?

# A linear model does no longer work
#m2 <- lm(diseased ~ stand, data = fh)
#coef(m2)
```

And now the promised data transformation:

```{r}
# Do the logit transformation by hand ...
d1 <- data.frame(
  stand = c("mixed", "deciduous"), 
  logit = table(fh$stand, fh$diseased) |> 
    apply(1, function(x) x[2] / sum(x)) |> 
    logit()
)
d1

# ... and then estimate an ordinary linear model.
m3 <- lm(logit ~ stand, data = d1)
coef(m3)

# Backtransformation gives us the same group means as the GLM.
inv.logit(coef(m3))
```

Interim interpretation: Just as in logarithmic regression, logistic regression performs a "in-model" transformation. Doing data transformation to linearize the data leads (in this example) to the same results. Now let's derive the typical disease model, modelling the disease probability over age. We thus add a continuous variable `age`. Any observation can be 0 or 1 only, we thus cannot calculate $p$ for the observations. A problem that not yet occurred (not in Lane (2002), not in our simpler disease models). We need to define groups with at least 2 observations to get $p$. Best would be to have multiple observations for each age, which is, however, not likely for continuous variables. We thus need to define intervals of ages.

```{r}
cut(fh$age, breaks = seq(20, 240, 20)) # 20-year-age-groups

d <- fh |> mutate(g = age - (age %% 25)) |> 
  group_by(g) |> 
  summarize(logit = logit(mean(diseased))) |> # Calc. logits for groups
  mutate(age = g + 12.5)

head(d)

self_tailored_glm_age <- lm(logit ~ age, data = d) # Fit a linear regression through the logits
coef(self_tailored_glm_age)
```

The logit-transformed data is indeed linear (more or less) and the back-transformed regression function shows indeed an s-shaped curve that looks familiar.

```{r}
p1 <- d %>% ggplot(aes(y = logit, x = age)) + geom_point() + geom_abline(intercept = coef(self_tailored_glm_age)["(Intercept)"],
                                                                   slope = coef(self_tailored_glm_age)["age"])
# @Johannes, da hab ich was falsch verstanden... 
p2 <- d %>% ggplot(aes(y = inv.logit(logit), x = age)) + geom_point() + geom_function(fun = function (x) {exp(2.59795 + 0.01391 * x) / (1 + exp(2.59795 + 0.01391 * x))})

p1 + p2
```


```{r}
glm_age <- glm(diseased ~ age, data = fh, family = binomial(link = "logit"))
coef(glm_age)

nd <- data.frame(age = c(10, 50, 100))
predict(self_tailored_glm_age, nd)
predict(glm_age, nd)

predict(self_tailored_glm_age, nd) |> inv.logit()
predict(glm_age, nd) |> inv.logit()
predict(glm_age, nd, type = "response")
```

We can do better by increasing the number of classes. And this already gives the argument why to use `GLM` instead of diy. 

```{r}
d <- fh |> mutate(g = age - (age %% 2)) |> 
  group_by(g) |> 
  summarize(logit = logit(mean(diseased))) |> 
  mutate(age = g + 1) |> 
  filter(is.finite(logit))

self_tailored_glm_age_2 <- lm(logit ~ age, data = d)
coef(self_tailored_glm_age_2)

predict(self_tailored_glm_age_2, nd) |> inv.logit()
predict(glm_age, nd) |> inv.logit()

# We now have many groups with 0 or very few observations. If we would include a 
# second covariate, e.g. stand, the situations becomes even worse.
```

__Task 3:__ Modeling a disease probability model 

- Calculate Logits by hand ???
- Create a univariate GLM over tree age
- Create a multiple GLM over age and self-chosen promising covariates, save separate to the simple GLM

```{r}
fh %>% ggplot(aes(y = diseased, x = age)) + geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "glm", method.args = list(family = binomial(link = "logit")))

glm_simple <- fh %>% glm(diseased ~ age, data = ., family = binomial(link = "logit"))
summary(glm_simple)
glm_multiple <- fh %>% select(age, elevation, soil, ph, fertilized, diseased) %>% 
  glm(diseased ~ ., data = .,  family = binomial(link = "logit"))
summary(glm_multiple)

fh %>% ggplot(aes(y = diseased, x = age, col = stand)) + geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "glm", method.args = list(family = binomial(link = "logit")))

ggeffects::ggeffect(glm_multiple, terms = c("age")) %>% plot()
ggeffects::ggeffect(glm_multiple, terms = c("elevation")) %>% plot()
ggeffects::ggeffect(glm_multiple, terms = c("soil")) %>% plot()
```
